# My VIA Keyboard Layouts

This repository contains my custom keyboard layouts for VIA-compatible keyboards. VIA is a powerful and flexible keyboard firmware that allows you to customize the layout and behavior of your keyboard. These layouts have been designed for my specific needs and preferences, and are shared here in case they are useful to others.

## Getting Started

To use these keyboard layouts, you will need to have a VIA-compatible keyboard and the VIA firmware installed on your computer. Once you have these set up, you can download the layout file (.json) from this repository and import it into VIA.

## Contributing

While I'm not accepting contributions at this time, you're welcome to use and modify the layouts in this repository for your own personal use.

## License

These keyboard layouts are released under the MIT License.
